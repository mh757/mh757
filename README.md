- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcel Hudiani.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
	- Numerical simulation for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE).
	- Statistical machine learning (enrolled in a class Fall 2024).

- **sde** is a project on numerical simulation of SDE that I started. The codes are written in MATLAB.

- **ml** is a folder with standalone codes I worked on for a statistical ML class. The codes are written in R.
